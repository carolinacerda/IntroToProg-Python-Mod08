## Creating a Script Using Object-Oriented Programming Techniques

### Introduction

#### Creating the Script

##### Classes, Objects, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

###### Creating a Constructor and Attributes

###### Creating Properties

###### Creating Methods

##### Processing Code for Saving and Reading Data from a File Using OOP

###### Saving Data to the File

###### Outputting Current List Items

###### Inputting New Product Data

#### Code for the Main Body of the Script

### Running the Script

By building upon the starter script for the assignment for Module 06, as well as the various listing examples provided by Professor Root and from the textbook, PythonÂ® Programming for the Absolute Beginner, Third Edition, by Michael Dawson, the following completed script is displayed below.

Finally, a verification of the success of the script is done by confirming that the data inputted by the user has successfully been saved within the text file, âproducts.txtâ (Figure 3).

### Summary
For this exercise, classes and their components were used to create a script that builds upon code seen previously throughout this course to manage a program that displays to the user a menu of options, outputs the current items in a list from a text file, allows the user to input new data, provides the option to save the data to a file, and then exit the program. Finally, GitHub Desktop was used to introduce a way to use GitHub directly from the computer as an application instead of from a browser or command line.
